# Flyway Pubs Demo with Branching - The Search branch

This is a sample feature branch of a ‘fake’ database development project that is designed for trying out Github-based branching with Flyway projects in SQL Server. It doesn’t require any scripting. It is based on the old Pubs database published by Sybase as their demo database. It was designed to be a mock database for book distributers. A huge body of code examples exists on the internet for it. I’ve added a few things to it in various stages of development, such as a way of searching for information, an accounting package, and a larger body of fake data. In the  current state of play, the development side has already absorbed a feature branch that created an accounting package, and there is a current feature branch testing out a fast search.
